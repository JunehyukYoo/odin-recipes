    <h1>Odin Recipes</h1>
    <p>This is my personal recipe website that includes easy to follow recipes that anyone can make. Note that these recipes are easy to make and not too expensive, perfect for a college student like myself. While these are the recipes I use, feel free to experiment and modify them as you wish. These recipes ARE NOT PERFECT.</p>
