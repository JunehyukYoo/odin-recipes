    <h3>Preparation</h3>
    <p>Estimated preparation and cooking time: 20 min</p>
    <p>Ingredients for 1-2 people:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>pasta</li>
        <li>2-3 egg yolks</li>
        <li>pancetta and/or guancale (thick cut bacon can be used as an alternative)</li>
        <li>25g parmesian cheese</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>optional: 1/2~1 clove(s) of garlic</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Note that there is no technical limit to the amount of pork or pasta you must use. Similarily, garlic is not part of the classic carbonara recipe, but can add a pinch of flavor to the dish.
        Adding extra egg yolks and cheese will also add to the viscocity of the sauce. Add more or less of these ingredients at your pleasure. These measurements are merely meant to act as a guideline.
    </p>

    <h3>Cooking</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Chop the pork into small chunks and set aside.</li> 
        <li>Separate egg yolks from white and combine with grated cheese in a separate bowl Add a pinch of salt and pepper and whisk until uniform.</li>
        <li>Put water in a pot, bring to a boil, and add your pasta in. Refer to the pasta box and cook until al dente. Once finished, save some pasta water in the pot and drain the rest.</li>
        <li>
            <dl>
                <dt>While the pasta is cooking, bring a pan to medium-high heat. Once heated, add and cook the chopped pork until golden. Note that no oil is needed as the pork will cook in its fat.</dt>
                <dd>Optional step: add minced garlic into the pan when the pork is almost finished and cook until golden.</dd>
            </dl>
        </li>
        <li>Take the pan off the heat and add in finished pasta into the pan. Toss the pasta so that it gets coated in the pork fat.</li>
        <li>Add around 2~3 tablespoons of leftover pasta water into the bowl with the cheese and egg. Add in slowly and make sure to whisk so that the pasta water does not cook the egg yolks.</li>
        <li>Ensuring that the pan with the pasta IS WARM AND NOT HOT, add in the sauce mixture slowly while vigorously mixing the pasta around in the pan so the eggs do not scramble.</li>
        <li>Grind some pepper over the top and serve on a plate!</li>

    </ol>
