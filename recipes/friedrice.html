    <h3>Preparation</h3>
    <p>Estimated preparation and cooking time: 30 min</p>
    <p>Ingredients for 1-2 people:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2~1 cups of rice</li>
        <li>1~2 eggs</li>
        <li>half an onion (white/yellow)</li>
        <li>1~2 cloves of garlic</li>
        <li>protein of your choice (recommended: chicken, beef, shrimp, bacon)</li>
        <li>soy sauce</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>optional: sesame oil and seeds</li>
        <li>optional: green onions</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Note that the protein selection is a personal selection. Protein is not technically needed but recommended.</p>

    <h3>Cooking</h3>
    <ol start="0">
        <li>Finish cooking rice at minimum 15 minutes before starting to cook other ingredients. Once rice is cooked, put in an airtight bowl (if possible) and put in refrigerator to cool before use.
            This will make the rice easier to work with when frying. 
        </li> 
        <li>Mince the garlic and chop onions and set aside. Cut protein into bitesized chunks (unless it is shrimp) and season with salt and/or pepper if needed.</li>
        <li>
            <dl>
                <dt>Bring a pan to medium-high heat. Once heated, add in oil and your protein and cook until golden, then set aside.</dt>
                <dd>Depending on the type of protein you are using, the cooking order may differ slightly. As you want all your ingredients to finish cooking at the same time,
                    make sure to cook proteins that take longer than the onions/garlic beforehand. If possible to cook simultaneously, you may do so.</dd>
            </dl>
        </li>
        <li>Add more oil into the pan if necessary. Add in your chopped onions first. Season with pepper and cook until the water has left the onions and they begin to brown. Add in the minced garlic and cook until golden brown.</li>
        <li>Add protein back into the pan. Add in chilled rice from the refrigerator into the pan. Begin mixing the rice with the rest of the ingredients. While mixing, drizzle in soy sauce to add umami and saltiness.</li>
        <li>Push all the ingredients to the side and make some space on the pan. Pour in your eggs and scramble them. Make sure not to combine the eggs with the rice until the egg is not runny.</li>
        <li>Add in more soy sauce, salt, and pepper to taste.</li>
        <li>Garnish with optional green onions and serve on a plate!</li>
